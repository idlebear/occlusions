# Pedestrian

Initial basis for a pedestrian environment for reinforcement learning -- training 'n' pedestrians to
interact without collisions.  One of those "pedestrians" may or may not be a robot.

## Trajectory Predictions

Integration with a trajectory prediction library [Trajectron++](https://github.com/idlebear/Trajectron-plus-plus) to make dynamic predictions of the other agents in the scene.
